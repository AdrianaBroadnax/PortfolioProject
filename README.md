# PortfolioProject

## My Task

My task for this week's homework assignment was to start my portfolio, in order to showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full time position.

I started by creating the repository with the name PortfolioProject, then I added it to VS Code and starting making files. I made a folder for my assets which has the images used and the #style.css file, then I created the html file.

# index.html
started off with the "!" to get the <!Doctype html> template to appear. I began coding first to make sure I hit most if not all of the requirements and then I did the style.css sheet. First, I linked the two pages together and then I added the title that will show up on the tag "Adriana's World"  my portfolio will have different projects that will explain what I am passionate about to tell employers more about me. 

Then I proceeded with the <Nav> at the top left of the page so employers can see a link how to contact, projects, and a little bit about me. I also added contact at the bottom of the page just in case. 
Added a Header to Welcome employers to Adriana's Portfolio, follow up with wha I am a full time Software Engineer. 
Add a recent photo of me
Add contact info at the bottom with my email, github, and portfolio

# style.css
For the header I wanted it centered with a yellow background
