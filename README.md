# PortfolioProject

## My Task

My task for this week's homework assignment was to start my portfolio, in order to showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full time position.

I started by creating the repository with the name PortfolioProject, then I added it to VS Code and starting making files. I made a folder for my assets which has the images used and the #style.css file, then I created the html file.

# index.html
I changed the name from "Adriana's World to "Coding Wonderland" since to me coding is a magical experience. You don't know if your code is broken or good to go until you test the magic! 
I added the nav bar with working functions;
the GitHub, LinkedIn, and Resume links have been added and working.
Then I wanted to update it and put a contact and an about me button instead
I added the second project Fast Track and 3 more homework assignments which consist of the note taker, employee tracker, and the readMe generator.
I also added a menu toggle, so if the screen was adjusted, the information will adjust to the screen size.
Under Projects, I already had the one project plus the 
My contact info has been added to the bottom of the page.


# style.css
For the header I wanted it centered with a yellow background, the hex code used for the font color was found in ProCreate.
For the body I wanted to add an image but was having problems, so I kept it a light bubblegum pink
Had to make sure everything has a display: flex; in order for it to wrap depending on the screen size.
