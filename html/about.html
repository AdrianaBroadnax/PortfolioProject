                    <p>Welcome to Adriana's World, my name is Adriana Broadnax and I am a Software Engineer!
                    Just a little bit about myself, I have 8+ year experience in customer service with a sprinkle of data entry. 
                    I have an addiction to tacos but only on tuesdays and dancing in the rain! 
                    I do have my bachelor's degree in Business Management and two certifications, one in human resources and the other in entrepreneurship.
